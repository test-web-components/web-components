      |Critical|A defect that completely hampers the major functionalities of a widget. There is no workaround.|
      |High|A defect in a major widget feature, causing it to behave differently than expected. It could lead to incorrect data persistence, data issues or wrong widget behaviors. There may be a workaround, but it is not obvious.|
      |Medium|A defect causing a widget feature to behave differently than expected but the impact is negligible to some extent or it doesn't have a major impact on widget's usage.|
      |Low|Any visual defects including spelling mistakes or alignment issues or font casing. No major functionality is affected. In terms of functionality, it is not affecting anything so we can mark as Low Severity. But since it has an impact on user experience, it may be fixed with higher frequency.|
